 *                   Procedure eval_charge_matrix
 *
 * Arguments:  cell: pointer to cell type
 *         eigenset: eigenset_type
 *          overlap: hermetian_matrix_type
 *         num_orbs: int
 * orbital_lookup_table: pointer to int.
 *         chg_matrix: pointer to real
 *             accum: pointer to real
 *
 *
 * Returns: none
 *
 * Action:  Evaluates the charge_matrix at the current k point
 *
 *  'chg_matrix is an array which is used to build the charge matrix... it should
 *    be num_orbs*num_orbs in size.
 *  'accum is an array which should be at least (number of atoms) long... it is
 *    just used to make this more efficient.
 *
 *  NOTE:  In the interests of efficiency, this function make assumptions
 *    about the form in which Hermetian matrices are stored.  If the
 *    representation ever changes, then this will need to be rewritten...
 *    ahhhhh, the suffering one must do for execution speed. :-)
